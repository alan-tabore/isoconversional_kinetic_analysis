# Kinetic Alanysis
## Description
This project aim to perform kinetic analysis and especially isoconversional kinetic analysis.
It offers the possibility to use simulated data thanks to the available kinetic models.
Feel free to implement other kinetic models or isoconversional methods.

## 1.Kinetic models

**Kamal and sourour equation:**
${dx \over dt} = \left( A_1 e^ \left( {−E_{a1}\over RT} \right) + A_2 e^\left( {−E_{a2}\over RT} \right) 𝑥^𝑚 \right) (1−𝑥)^𝑛 $
$x$: extent of reaction
$t$: time
$A_i$: Pre-exponential factor for reaction i
$E_i$: Activation energy for reaction i (J/mol)
$R$: Universal gas constant (J/(mol.K))
$T$: Temperature (K)
$m$: Reaction order of the autocatalytic reaction
$n$: Reaction order of reaction

**Two parallel reaction first order reactions**
${dx \over dt} = A_1 e^ \left( {−E_{a1}\over RT}\right) (1−𝑥) + A_2 e^\left( {−E_{a2}\over RT} \right) (1−𝑥) $
$x$: extent of reaction
$t$: time
$A_i$: Pre-exponential factor for reaction i
$E_i$: Activation energy for reaction i (J/mol)
$R$: Universal gas constant (J/(mol.K))
$T$: Temperature (K)
